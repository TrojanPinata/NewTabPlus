# New Tab Plus
So, as you may know if you are reading this, firefox's new tab page is VERY limited. This extension serves to take away a few of those limits by adding support for local html and css.

# Installation
This extension, sadly, will never be on the firefox extension store, or whatever it's called. Ihat is because it should be installed from a file, as to allow for its cusomization.
To put this simply, download the repository as a zip and unpack it. Take whatever html/css/fonts and copy them into wherever the unpacked zip files are. Zip it all back up and rename it "extensions@newtabplus.xpi" and blam-o there you go. Now all you have to do is go to firefox addons (aka about:addons) and click on the settings gear and add from file.

# Credit
Tabliss created all of the framework behind this, I just hacked it to fit my needs. I noticed tabliss managed to get their extension to modify the new tab page and just wanted to change a few things to get what I want. If something is broken, it's probably because I fucked it up to do something it was never supposed to do.
